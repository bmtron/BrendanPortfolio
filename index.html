                <h2>Hello, my name is Brendan, and I am a full-stack web developer with a flair for functionality.
                </h2>
                <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful's Full Stack web development program. Ever since       I built my first computer, I have had a growing 
                    passion for technology in all its facets, but more specifically with learning how software functions. Solving unique problems in creative 
                    ways is what drives me, and the more I explored programming and software development, the more I fell in love with it. The process of 
                    turning an idea into code, and watching that code become a useful, hands on solution never ceases to excite me. Through building 
                    a multitude of well structured, reusable functions and crafting user friendly, accessible UI, I have taken my passion and put it to use,
                    solving problems one web page at a time.</p>
